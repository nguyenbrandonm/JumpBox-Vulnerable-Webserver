# Security Policy

## Purpose
This repository contains an **intentionally vulnerable application security and Active Directory lab** used for authorized training, learning, and portfolio demonstration purposes. Certain weaknesses are deliberately introduced to simulate real-world risk scenarios in a controlled and isolated environment.

This policy explains how security issues related to the **lab infrastructure itself** (not the intended vulnerabilities) should be reported.

## Intended Vulnerabilities
Some security weaknesses in this repository are **intentional by design** and documented as part of the learning objectives. These are not considered security issues and do not require reporting.

Examples include:
- Deliberate web application flaws
- Misconfigurations used for demonstration
- Weak credentials or trust assumptions used in lab scenarios

## Reporting Unintended Vulnerabilities
If you discover a security issue that is **not part of the intended lab design**, such as:
- Accidental exposure of secrets or credentials
- Vulnerabilities that affect the host system or users outside the lab
- Issues that could cause unintended harm or instability

Please report it responsibly.

### How to Report
- Open a GitHub Issue **without posting exploit details publicly**, or
- Contact the repository owner directly via LinkedIn

**LinkedIn:** https://www.linkedin.com/in/nguyenbrandonm

## Disclosure Expectations
- Reports will be reviewed on a best-effort basis
- You may be asked for additional clarification
- Issues deemed out of scope or aligned with intended lab behavior may be closed without remediation

## Scope Limitations
This project:
- Is not intended for production use
- Should only be deployed in isolated, non-internet-facing lab environments
- Is not supported for use against real-world systems or networks

Users are responsible for ensuring they have proper authorization before testing.
